# Messenger and Facebook Platform Sample Apps

This is a collection of sample applications that exercise some feature of the Messenger or Facebook Platforms. My goal is to make these as straightforward and easy to try as possible. They aren't beautiful, but they should get you going.

I hope you find them helpful! :heart:
